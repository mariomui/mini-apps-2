#Json-servr app

Build a React UI that allows the user to search for historical events based on a keyword. Use the full-text search features of json-server to return a result to the UI for browsing. Paginate the list of events using react-paginate, loading no more than ten at a time. Ensure you are implementing server-side pagination NOT client-side pagination.
